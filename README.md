# Ride-sharing-Matching-Algorithm
This project explores the development and optimization of algorithms for matching riders with passengers in a ride-sharing platform. The objective is to create an efficient, dynamic matching system that optimizes for factors such as pickup and drop-off locations, time preferences, and overall travel efficiency.
